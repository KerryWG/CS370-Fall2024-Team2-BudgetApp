------------------------------ TEAMWORK STATEMENT -----------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		Our team has established collective goals and strategies to ensure success in both 
our labs and final project, while maintaining balance with other academic courses. We 
aim to work efficiently, take advantage of each member’s strengths, and hold each other 
accountable throughout the semester. 


----- Team Goals -----

		Our primary goal is to complete all labs and Java exercises by Saturday night each 
week. This will allow us to correct any errors before the Monday night due date, or it 
will give the team extra time to focus on other courses and responsibilities, ensuring 
that the workload is manageable for everyone. Completing labs and exercises on time is 
crucial for staying on trach for deadlines and maintaining a steady workflow. Additionally, 
the team is focused on completing the design phase of the Finance Budgeting App by 
September 25th. This will enable us to move forward with the development phase in an 
organized and efficient manner. We aim to agree on a development timeline by this data 
as well, with the goal of starting actual development (code) no later than October 2nd. 
These checkpoints will guide our progress, ensuring we are consistently meetingdeadlines 
and can deliver the final project on time. 


----- Team Coordination and Communication -----

		Effective communication is essential for achieving our goals by each checkpoint 
(date) proposed. The team will use the “Team 2 Supremacy” Discord server for all 
communication regarding labs, Java exercises, and final project development. Each 
team member is responsible for checking the Discord server at least once per day and 
responding to questions, comments, or suggestions within 24 hours. This ensures that 
any issues or concerns are addressed in a timely manner, preventing delay in completing 
any tasks. In addition to daily communication, members will provide assignment updates 
on Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday nights. For the final project, development updates 
will be shared every Friday until the due date, allowing the team to monitor progress 
and make any necessary adjustments. Furthermore, if any member plans to miss a lab or 
lecture, they will inform the team via Discord, ensuring transparency and accountability. 

 

----- Individual Strengths and Task Distribution -----

		Our team is composed of three members: KC, Panny, and Kerry. KC is an advanced 
Java programmer while Panny is proficient in Java as well. Kerry, on the other hand, 
is new to Java but is dedicated to improving her skills throughout the semester. 
Given these different skill levels, we will allocate tasks in a way that plays to 
each member’s trengths while allowing everyone to contribute to the design and 
development of the final project. Every Tuesday, during lab time, the team will 
distribute tasks based on the week’s objectives. We will conduct mid-week check-in 
every Thursday to make sure tasks are on track and address any issues encountered. 
If any member is struggling to complete their assigned task by Saturday night, 
adjustments will be made to redistribute the workload and offer support where needed. 
This flexible approach will assist in staying on schedule and that no member feels 
overwhelmed or overworked.  

 
----- Mutual Accountability and Decision-Making -----

		To promote accountability, team decisions will be made through amajority-rule 
system. If a member disagrees with the majority, they have the opportunity to present 
additional information that supports their idea or expresses concerns. This allows 
every member to have their own voice and that decisions are made collaboratively. 
In addition to lecture and lab hours, each team member has commited to dedicating at 
least six hours per week to the project. Beginning on September 25th, we will meet 
every other Wednesday from 2:30 PM to 5:00 PM on campus to work together. If any 
member is unable to attend these sessions, they will inform the team in advance so 
that alternative arrangements can be made. 

 

----- Risk Management and Prevention Strategies -----

		We have identified several potential risks that could impact on our project. 
These include heavy workloads from other classes, Java proficiency differences, and 
the possibility of a team member dropping the class. To mitigate these risks, we 
will maintain open lines of communication and regularly check-in with each other 
regarding workloads and progress. If any member feels overwhelmed or overworked, the 
team will adjust assignment tasks or project timeline to accommodate their needs. To 
address the different levels of Java skills, we will utilize industry standards for 
in-code comments and practice pair-programming, allowing members to collaborate and 
support each other’s learning. This will also help ensure that, in the event a team 
member is unavailable due to personal circumstances, the remaining team members can 
step in and continue the project without significant disruption. By adhering to all 
the aforementioned strategies and maintaining a collaborative, flexible approach, we 
are confident that our team will meet all deadlines and deliver a successful final 
project.
